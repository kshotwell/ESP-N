Documents within this series reflect sound professional work and may be referenced in the formal scientific and technical literature. These are available [online](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/) and the latest publications for each survey are listed below. \n\n**POCs:** \nBering Sea: Emily Markowitz, Liz Dawson, Chris Anderson\nGulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands: margaret Siple, Alex Dowlin\n\n### Community Highlights\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nEach year, the Groundfish Assessment Program compiles it’s survey findings for communities around Alaska [@2022NBSCommunity]. *Please note: This document is for informational purposes only and does not necessarily represent the views or official position of the Department of Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the National Marine Fisheries Service. Not to be cited without permission from the authors. *\n\n**POCs:** Bering Sea: Emily Markowitz, Liz Dawson, Chris Anderson\n\n### North Pacific Groundfish Plan Team\n\nEach year, the survey teams present their findings to the North Pacific Groundfish Plan Team. Find those presentations, recordings, and attachments on the [North Pacific Fishery Management Council website](https://www.npfmc.org/about-the-council/plan-teams/bsai-and-goa-groundfish/). \n### Research Briefs\n\nEach year, the Groundfish Assessment Program produces research briefs, or research plans, of their upcoming surveys and research. \n\n### Code Books\n\nThe [Species and Gear Code book](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/groundfish-survey-species-code-manual-and-data-codes-manual) is a listing of codes used for fish and invertebrates identified in RACE Division surveys. \n\n**POCs:** Nancy Roberson\n\n### Survey Protocols\n\nGroundfish bottom trawl survey protocols are documented in [NOAA protocols for groundfish bottom trawl surveys of the nation’s fishery resources](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/12855). \n\n**POCs:** Nancy Roberson\n\n## NOAA Fisheries Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (DisMAP)\n\nData from this and other fisheries-independent surveys are used in the [NOAA Fisheries Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (DisMAP)](https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/dismap/), which provides easy access to information to track and understand distributions of marine species in U.S. Marine Ecosystems.\n\n**POCs:** NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and Technology\n\n## R Packages\n\n- [akgfmaps R package](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/akgfmaps): bottom trawl survey maps layers and plotting examples. **POC:** Sean Rohan\n- [coldpool R package](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/coldpool): cold pool area and temperature data products for the Bering Sea. **POC:** Sean Rohan\n- [akfishcondition R package](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/akfishcondition): groundfish morphometric condition indicators for fish in the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska. **POC:** Sean Rohan\n- [gapindex R package](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gapindex): calculation of Design-Based Indices of Abundance and Composition for AFSC GAP Bottom Trawl Surveys. **POC:** Zack Oyafuso\n\n## Outreach\n\nMaps of [near real-time temperatures and survey progress from each of our bottom trawl surveys](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/bottom-trawl-survey-temperature-maps) are posted each business day of the survey. Water temperature affects many species' spawning times, access to food, growth rates, and overall range. Collecting temperature data helps better understand species’ habitats and the larger ecosystem. **POCs:** Bering Sea: Emily Markowitz, Liz Dawson, Chris Anderson\n\n## Collaborators\n\nOur data are used in many annual publications, including but not limited to the list below: \n\n- [Alaska Stock Assessments](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/population-assessments/alaska-stock-assessments)\n- [North Pacific Groundfish Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation Reports](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/population-assessments/north-pacific-groundfish-stock-assessment-and-fishery-evaluation)\n- [Groundfish Economic Status Reports for the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/groundfish-economic-status-reports-gulf-alaska-and-bering-sea-and-aleutian-islands)\n- [Alaska Marine Ecosystem Status Report Database](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/alaska-marine-ecosystem-status-report-archive)\n- [Southeast Alaska Coastal Monitoring Survey Reports](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/southeast-alaska-coastal-monitoring-survey-reports)\n- [Alaska Fisheries Life History Database](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/alaska-fisheries-life-history-database)\n- [Essential Fish Habitat Research Plan in Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/habitat-conservation/essential-fish-habitat-research-plan-alaska)\n",
